# CodingBat solutions

Thanks to Nick Parlante, the computer science lecturer at Stanford who created CodingBat, I was able to understand recursion better and hopefully embark on learning Python.

CodingBat is a website where you solve various problems to improve your coding. There are two languages available currently, Python and Java. 

My solutions here pass all the test cases.
